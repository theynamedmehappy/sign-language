# sign language

#### While several sign language translation models have been developed for various sign languages, there is a specific need for a robust and accurate model for Indian Sign Language (ISL). The uniqueness of ISL and its distinct linguistic features require tailored approaches and resources for effective translation. Currently, the availability of comprehensive ISL translation systems is limited, hindering effective communication between deaf and hearing individuals in India.

#### The primary goal of this project is to design and develop a state-of-the-art sign language translation model for ISL, which can accurately recognize and translate ISL gestures into spoken or written language. By addressing the specific challenges of ISL translation, this project aims to enhance accessibility, promote inclusivity, and facilitate communication between the deaf community and the Wider society.
